This game is based on the Argon Assault section of the GameDev.tv Unity 3D course.

My original implementations are:

Level built with Unity Terrain Tools and Terrain Toolkit:. The bridge was built with SabreCSG.
Added different kind of enemies apart from flying enemies.
Design of machine gun heating mechanic. When completely overheated, player can shoot until machin gun cools down. However, bullets shot while on red area will do double damage.
The game runs on an infinite loop.
