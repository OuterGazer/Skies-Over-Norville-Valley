This game is based on the Argon Assault section of the GameDev.tv Unity 3D course.

My original implementations are:

- Level built with Unity Terrain Tools and Terrain Toolkit:. The bridge was built with SabreCSG.
- Added different kind of enemies apart from flying enemies. In total there are 3 differetn types of enemy planes, 2 different tanks and 3 different ships. All of them with different behaviours compared to their peers.
- Design of machine gun heating mechanic. When completely overheated, player can shoot until machin gun cools down. However, bullets shot while on red area will do double damage.
- The game runs on an infinite loop.
